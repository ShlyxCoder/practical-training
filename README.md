This repository contains code from a university training project, focused on exploring and implementing foundational deep learning models. The main goals of the project include:

* Building and training **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)** for simple classification tasks
* Designing and evaluating **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image-based data

All code is written in **Python**, leveraging the **PyTorch** deep learning framework for model construction, training, and evaluation.

Throughout the project, we explored key components of neural networks, such as activation functions, loss functions, optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam), and experimented with different architectures and training strategies.

This repository also includes utility scripts for data preprocessing, training loops, and performance evaluation, making it easy to reproduce results or adapt the code for similar learning tasks.
